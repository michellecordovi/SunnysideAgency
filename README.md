## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This projects really allowed me to practice my CSS positioning and CSS grid layout. This was a great learning experience as I was able to practice making a drop down menu with CSS only and practice making triangle shapes with CSS for that drop down menu. I also learned how to use and modify svg images.


### Continued development

I am proud that I was able to create a drop down menu using CSS only, but in future projects I plan to learn how to use javascript to achieve this same function.

### Useful resources

- [The Shapes of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/) - This helped me learn how to make a triangle with CSS so I could add it to my mobile drop down menu
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - The CSS tricks website was very helpful for helping me learn how to use SVG images and how to make a drop down menu without javascript.
